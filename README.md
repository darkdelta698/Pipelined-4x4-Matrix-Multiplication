# Pipelined 4×4 Matrix Multiplier (SystemVerilog)

A 4×4 matrix multiplier implemented in **SystemVerilog** using a **3-stage pipelined architecture** (multiplication → partial sums → final summation). Includes a testbench for simulation and verification.



## 🚀 Features
- Implements **4×4 matrix multiplication** in hardware.
- **Three pipeline stages** for improved performance:
  1. Multiplication of elements
  2. Pairwise addition of partial products
  3. Final summation
- Synchronous reset support.
- Verified with testbench and sample matrices.
- Generates console outputs and waveforms (`.vcd`).

🛠️ Simulation This project was tested using: Icarus Verilog EDA Playground GTKWave for waveform viewing
